# coding_challenge

A short coding challenge for interview candidates of CSE 250, CSE 350, and Math 335.

## Challenge Description

Our data science program uses R, Python, and SQL heavily.  CSE 250 is taught entirely in Python with some SQL.  CSE 350/Math 335 is taught entirely in R.  Both courses require the faculty to have some proficiency with GitHub.
