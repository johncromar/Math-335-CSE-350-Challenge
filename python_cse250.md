This challenge is a short assignment in our data wrangling and visualization course that is done in R.  We would like you to do it the task in Python using Pandas and Altair.

You can read about the baseball data at [seanlahman.com](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).  Please use the [SQLite](https://github.com/WebucatorTraining/lahman-baseball-mysql/raw/master/lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite) database as your data sources.

## The Class Task

Over the campfire, you and a friend get into a debate about which college in Utah has had the best MLB success. As an avid BYU fan, you want to prove your point, and you go to data to settle the debate. You need a clear visualization that depicts the performance of BYU players compared to other Utah college players that have played in the major leagues. This data is great for testing out our relational data skills.
