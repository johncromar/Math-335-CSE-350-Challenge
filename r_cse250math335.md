Use [the Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to create a unique chart for each of the four questions below.  This challenge is a two week assignment in our data science programming class that is done in Python. 

Here is the [data](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv) for the challenge.

## Background

Background
Early in prehistory, some descriptive names began to be used again and again until they formed a name pool for a particular culture. Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.

With the rise of Christianity, certain trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today, in various forms. These were spread by early missionaries throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.

By the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, which were a combination of native names and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native.
